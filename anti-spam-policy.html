        <p>At <em>Forget The Stamps</em>, we take spam and permission very seriously. By creating an account you are agreeing to this anti-spam policy.</p>
        
        <div class="sc-box note full">The law isn't enough, it's permission that counts!</div>
        
        <p>While the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN-SPAM_Act_of_2003">CAN-SPAM laws</a> are a step in the right direction for reducing the spam problem, we don&#39;t feel they go far enough. Our definition of spam goes beyond the laws in most countries and encompasses what we believe to be true permission email marketing.</p>
        
        <div class="sc-box note full">Spam is any email you send to someone who hasn't given you their direct permission to contact them on the topic of the email.</div>
        
        <p>But that&#39;s not enough. Permission is a fuzzy word open to interpretation. Let&#39;s get into some specific scenarios so it&#39;s clear what does and doesn&#39;t constitute permission.</p>
        
        <h4 id="what-kind-of-email-addresses-are-ok-to-send-to-with-forget-the-stamps">What kind of email addresses are OK to send to with <em>Forget The Stamps</em>?</h4>
        
        <p>To send email to anyone using <em>Forget The Stamps</em>, you must have clearly obtained their permission. This could be done through:</p>
        
        <div class="shortcode-unorderedlist tick">
        <ul>
        <li>An email newsletter **subscribe form** on your web site.</li>
        <li>An opt-in checkbox on a form. This checkbox must not be checked by default, the person completing the form **must willingly select** the checkbox to indicate they want to hear from you.</li>
        <li>If someone **completes an offline form** like a survey or enters a competition, you can only contact them if it was explained to them that they would be contacted by email <em>AND</em> they ticked a box indicating they would like to be contacted.</li>
        <li>Customers who have purchased from you **within the last 2 years**.</li>
        <li>If someone **gives you their business card** and you have explained to them that you will be in touch by email, you can contact them. If they dropped their business card in a fishbowl at a trade show, there must be a sign indicating they will be contacted by email.</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p>Basically, you can only ever email anyone who has clearly given you permission to email them specifically about the subject you&#39;re contacting them about.</p>
        
        <h4 id="what-kind-of-email-addresses-are-not-ok-to-send-to-with-forget-the-stamps">What kind of email addresses ARE NOT OK to send to with <em>Forget The Stamps</em>?</h4>
        
        <p>Anything outside the examples above doesn&#39;t equal permission in our eyes, but here are some examples to make sure we&#39;re crystal clear. By using <em>Forget The Stamps</em>, you agree not to import or send to any email address which:</p>
        
        <div class="shortcode-unorderedlist red-x">
        <ul>
        <li>You **do not have explicit, provable permission** to contact in relation to the topic of the email you're sending.</li>
        <li>You bought, loaned, rented or in any way acquired **from a third party**, no matter what they claim about quality or permission. You need to obtain permission yourself.</li>
        <li>You **haven't contacted via email in the last 2 years**. Permission doesn't age well and these people have either changed email address or won't remember giving their permission in the first place.</li>
        <li>You **scraped or copy and pasted** from the web. Just because people publish their email address doesn't mean they want to hear from you.</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p>Sure, some of these people might have given you their email address, but what&#39;s missing is your permission to email them commercial messages. Blasting promotional emails to any of these people won&#39;t be effective and will more than likely see your email marked as spam by many of your recipients.</p>
        
        <h4 id="what-content-must-i-include-in-my-email">What content MUST I include in my email?</h4>
        
        <p>Every email you send using <strong>Forget The Stamps</strong> must include the following:</p>
        
        <ol>
          <li>A <strong>single-click unsubscribe link</strong> that instantly removes the subscriber from your list. Once they unsubscribe, you can never email them again.</li>
          <li>The <strong>name and physical address of the sender</strong>. If you&#39;re sending an email for your client, you&#39;ll need to include your client&#39;s details instead.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4 id="how-well-know-if-you-dont-have-permission">How we&#39;ll know if you don&#39;t have permission</h4>
        
        <p><em>Forget The Stamps</em> has numerous layers of approval and monitoring to ensure you comply with our anti-spam policy. Here&#39;s a few of them:</p>
        
        <ol>
          <li>Until your account has been approved by a member of our team, <strong>every email you send</strong> will need to be approved.</li>
          <li>Our software is directly integrated into the <strong>spam reporting systems</strong> for some of the biggest ISP&#39;s like Hotmail and AOL. If you don&#39;t have permission and someone marks your campaign as spam, we&#39;ll know about it the moment that button is pressed. If you receive a complaint rate greater than 0.25% of all recipients (that&#39;s 25 complaints for every 10,000 recipients) your account will be terminated. This is a generous figure that takes into account false spam reports.</li>
          <li>Our team <strong>verifies all large lists</strong> imported into our software. Until we&#39;ve given it the all clear, you can&#39;t send to it.</li>
          <li>We <strong>monitor blacklists and our abuse accounts</strong> all day every day. We can pinpoint who is causing us delivery problems or attracting complaints very easily.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>If we do discover that you&#39;re emailing people without their permission, we will terminate your account with <em>Forget The Stamps</em> immediately.</p>
        
        <p>In the end, it&#39;s really common sense. Take off your marketing hat and put yourself in your recipient&#39;s shoes. If they don&#39;t recognize who you are or aren&#39;t interested in what you&#39;re sending, they&#39;ll think you&#39;re a spammer. It&#39;s that simple.</p>
